# Problem of Using the Solarized Theme in Neovim

Seems like the original [solarized theme plugin](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) doesn't work for neovim after some version: <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28791>. The alternative is the [nvim-solarized-lua](https://github.com/ishan9299/nvim-solarized-lua).
